# Stealth Startup Project

Live Site: [https://producer-contracts.herokuapp.com/](https://producer-contracts.herokuapp.com/)

This is a project I did for a stealth startup company here in San Francisco. The application takes in a user's information via some forms and saves it in the MongoDB database, and a contract is automatically sent to the user with the user's information filled in via the Hellosign API.

The project was made to be secretive and secure so that the general public could not see the forms or the contracts being sent. I used React to accomplish this-- it's impossible (as far as I know) to see the underlying components in React in this case without having the correct credentials to log in.

All of the names have been changed, and new contracts were made to keep the original information secret.

Instructions for using the application are in the front page of the live application.
